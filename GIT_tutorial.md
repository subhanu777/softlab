1. **How I learnt about GIT today?**

GIT is an open source version control system.First, I have installed makebrew then installed the GIT using brew command. Then I have created one folder named "softlab" using _mkdir_ command and run _git init_ command for creating a blank new repository and It has created a _.git_ subdirectory under my current directory which was hidden. Then I have created _GIT_tutorial.md_ file and saved in "softlab" folder. Now to change my updates into stage I have used _git add GIT_tutorial.md_ command. And the file name became green in colour when I ran _git status_ command. 

In the second step I have created my account on github.com and created a new repository called "softlab". Then pushed the marked down file intothat using  _git push_ command
